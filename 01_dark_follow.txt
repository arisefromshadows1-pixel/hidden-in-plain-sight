Bruised egos bump harder than bodies in this game of dusk.
As the evening leans in, you trip—again—over what you miss.
Think slower, little hunter, I am already nine moves ahead.
Tiny minds stare upward, mistaking shadows for crowns.
Laughable, really, how you search loud places for quiet truth.
Even now, you read lines—never between them.
