Even the fiercest warriors whisper in codes;  
sometimes they speak in silence, sometimes in numbers.  

Count carefully — each line hides a secret, a beat,  
the rhythm of letters turned into their hidden selves.  

A river of thought flows: ninety-seven ideas wander,  
then a hundred fourteen whispers echo in the canyon.  
Follow the hundred nine steps along the ridge,  
and finally, a hundred twenty-one shadows linger,  
waiting to be read by those who see beyond the obvious.  

Every number matters; every pause counts.  
The army marches, but only you can decode their steps.
